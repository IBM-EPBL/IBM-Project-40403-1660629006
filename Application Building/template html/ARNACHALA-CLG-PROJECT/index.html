                        detection of skin cancer, psoriasis. Basically, skin disease diagnosis depends on the different
                        characteristics like color, shape, texture etc. Here the person capture the images of skin and
                        then image will be sent the trained model.Not all skin disorders respond to treatment. Some
                        conditions go away without treatment. People with permanent skin conditions often go through
                        periods of severe symptoms. Sometimes people are able to force incurable conditions into
                        remission. However, most skin conditions reappear due to certain triggers, such as stress or
                        illness.</p>
