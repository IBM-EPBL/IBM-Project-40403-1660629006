                Nowadays people are suffering from skin diseases, More than 125 million people suffering form
                psoriasis also skin cancer rate is rapidly increasing over the last few decades especially
                Melanoma is most diversifying skin cancer. If skin diseases are not treated at an earlier stage
                then it may lead to complication in the body including spreading of the infection from one
                individual to the other. The skin diseases can br prevented by investing the infected region at an early
                stage. The characteristic of the skin images is diversified so that it is challenging job to devise an
                efficient and robust algorithm for automatic detection of skin disease and its severity. Skin tone and
                skin color play an important role in skin disease detection. Color and coarseness of skin are visually
                different. Automatic processing of such images for skin analysis requires quantitative discriminator to
                differentiate the diseases.
